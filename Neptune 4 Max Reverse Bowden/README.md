NEPTUNE 4 MAX REVERSE BOWDEN.
Whatever i make, i make sure that no other or very less external things are needed to get it done.
overengineering should make things simpler.
The Filament Sensor Cover must be printed with TPU.
The Extruder Screw Should also be printer with some flex material like TPU or Nylon.
Rest of parts would be just fine with PLA/ABS/PETG/Nylon.
With Siemens NX 2306 and 2212

NOTE: This Might Not be needed for PLA/PETG but for hygroscopic filaments this is needed for longer print durations.
this can directly used to spool filaments from dryer. the purpose is not better layer adhesion or bla bla.
