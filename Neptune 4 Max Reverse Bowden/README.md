NEPTUNE 4 MAX REVERSE BOWDEN.
Whatever i make, i make sure that no other or very less external things are needed to get it done.
overengineering should make things simpler.
The Filament Sensor Cover must be printed with TPU.
The Extruder Screw Should also be printer with some flex material like TPU or Nylon.
Rest of parts would be just fine with PLA/ABS/PETG/Nylon.
