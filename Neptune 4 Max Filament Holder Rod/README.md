#ELEGOO NEPTUNE 4 MAX Filament Holder Rod

So this is just to get the measurements, later i'll modify it to somehow add connection to a filament dryer directly via 
a teflon tube directly to filament sensor. maybe ill need to design a case kind of design for filament sensor for 
teflon tube to fit..
