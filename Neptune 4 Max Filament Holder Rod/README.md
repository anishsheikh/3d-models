#ELEGOO NEPTUNE 4 MAX Filament Holder Rod

So this is just to get the measurements, later i'll modify it to somehow add connection to a filament dryer directly via 
a teflon tube directly to filament sensor. maybe ill need to design a case kind of design for filament sensor for 
teflon tube to fit..
for rapid prototyping and using measuring tools like callipers and rulers. its easier to use a notebook.
but well i can do this too. it feels better to copy and modify american and western tech tho. idk why.
everything is dual purpose for them. just dont shove it in your ass as it might not fit.
