In Neptune 4 Max the belt tension adjuster is completely riveted nut. Because its an open belt there should be 
no issue with normal one, still i made my own version which is just a bit tighter and has groves. 

 why? 
 the microvibrations from stress can be dampened just by making the part a bit more closer to the enclosure.
 This test print is made with Nylon6 for inner gear, polycarbonate for the body,95A TPU for innerwheel bush , M3x20mm for holding the wheel,
 M3x50mm for adjustment aligner, 685ZZ miniature bearing for wheel.
