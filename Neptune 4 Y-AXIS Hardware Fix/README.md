ELEGOO NEPTUNE 4 Y AXIS FIX
this model does have some sort of issue with input shaper calibration on y axis over higher vibration frequencies.
most probabably because 2/3 y axis bolt rotors don't have any groves in it. making friction on higher frequencies generate nonlinear noise.
now on this would have some amount of precision back.
better layer adhesion on y axis. infill on lower lenghts would be better.
precise measurements for two 625RS bearings.
happy new year to all intelligent but dumbos. we both hate and love each other . no hiding .
