ELEGOO NEPTUNE 4 Y AXIS FIX
this model does have some sort of issue with input shaper calibration on y axis over higher vibration frequencies.
most probabably because 2/3 y axis bolt rotors don't have any groves in it. making friction on higher frequencies generate nonlinear noise.
now on this would have some amount of precision back.
better layer adhesion on y axis. infill on lower lenghts would be better.
precise measurements for two 625RS bearings.
1/1/2024 : Updated the edge blends due to reduction of torque because of elastic vibrational motion dampening while timing belt edge collides with rotor edges.
           more precise bottom holder to actually make use of the bearing. Mechanical Engineering??????
